        <h1>My web design advertisement!!</h1>

        <p>As a web developer, I have a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as experience working with popular web frameworks such as React and Angular.
        I am skilled in creating responsive, user-friendly designs and have a keen eye for detail when it comes to crafting visually appealing and functional websites.
        I also have experience working with back-end technologies such as Node.js and Express, and am comfortable working with databases such as MySQL and MongoDB.
        Additionally, I am proficient in using Git for version control and collaborating with other developers.
        Overall, I am passionate about web development and am always seeking new opportunities to expand my skills and knowledge in this field.</p>
